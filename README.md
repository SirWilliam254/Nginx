# Nginx

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a high-performance, open-source web server and reverse proxy software that can handle a large number of simultaneous connections and requests. It was designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to configure and has become a popular choice for web servers and load balancers.

Nginx is commonly used as a web server to serve static content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and as a reverse proxy to forward requests to other servers, such as application servers or other web servers. It can also be used to cache frequently accessed content, which can significantly improve website performance.

Nginx is known for its lightweight and efficient architecture, which allows it to handle a large number of requests with low resource utilization. It supports multiple programming languages and frameworks and can be configured using various configuration languages, including a high-level configuration language called NGINX Configuration Language (NCL) and a low-level configuration language called Embedded Perl.

In addition to serving web content, Nginx can also be used for various other purposes, such as serving streaming media, load balancing, and SSL termination.
